# SheetyRecognizer

## Overview

The *ULTIMATE* goal of this project is to build a machine learning pipeline able to convert visual sheet music into Lilypond.

My previous attempts can be found in SheetMusicGenerator, which I am rewriting to a kedro framework.

Current status - mock data generation is almost finished.

Next steps:
- finish data generation (add a bash script to compile the .ly files)
- reimplement "data science" pipeline (data split, model setup, model train, model evaluate...)
- improve data generation (no music is ever random, right now it is)
- improve the model (dictionary fix)

This is your new Kedro project, which was generated using `kedro 0.19.6`.

## Rules and guidelines

In order to get the best out of the template:

* Don't remove any lines from the `.gitignore` file we provide
* Make sure your results can be reproduced by following a data engineering convention
* Don't commit data to your repository
* Don't commit any credentials or your local configuration to your repository. Keep all your credentials and local configuration in `conf/local/`

## How to install dependencies

Declare any dependencies in `requirements.txt` for `pip` installation.

To install them, run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run your Kedro pipeline

You can run your Kedro project with:

```
kedro run
```

## How to test your Kedro project

Have a look at the file `src/tests/test_run.py` for instructions on how to write your tests. You can run your tests as follows:

```
pytest
```

You can configure the coverage threshold in your project's `pyproject.toml` file under the `[tool.coverage.report]` section.


## Project dependencies

To see and update the dependency requirements for your project use `requirements.txt`. You can install the project requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## How to work with Kedro and notebooks

> Note: Using `kedro jupyter` or `kedro ipython` to run your notebook provides these variables in scope: `context`, 'session', `catalog`, and `pipelines`.
>
> Jupyter, JupyterLab, and IPython are already included in the project requirements by default, so once you have run `pip install -r requirements.txt` you will not need to take any extra steps before you use them.

### Jupyter
To use Jupyter notebooks in your Kedro project, you need to install Jupyter:

```
pip install jupyter
```

After installing Jupyter, you can start a local notebook server:

```
kedro jupyter notebook
```

### JupyterLab
To use JupyterLab, you need to install it:

```
pip install jupyterlab
```

You can also start JupyterLab:

```
kedro jupyter lab
```

### IPython
And if you want to run an IPython session:

```
kedro ipython
```

### How to ignore notebook output cells in `git`
To automatically strip out all output cell contents before committing to `git`, you can use tools like [`nbstripout`](https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout). For example, you can add a hook in `.git/config` with `nbstripout --install`. This will run `nbstripout` before anything is committed to `git`.

> *Note:* Your output cells will be retained locally.
